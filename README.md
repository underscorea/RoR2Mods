# RoR2Mods
i dont know what im doing

# Boilerplate
this repo has a solution that uses `Directory.Build.targets` to automatically link projects with installed assemblies (i.e. you have to have bepinex installed before you open solution and try to build it  
it will try to find the location of risk of rain 2 based on the registry for both the game and steam  
right now its at windows only but if i see an interest to get it to work with others, i might change it

# Mods
